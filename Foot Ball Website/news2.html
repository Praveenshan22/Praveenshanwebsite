    <p>FC Barcelona has opened its first a Barça Store in Madrid, in Calle Arenal, near Puerta del Sol. This further consolidates the expansion of the network of stores managed 100% by the Club. The opening was attended by the FC Barcelona director responsible for roller hockey, Xavier Barbany, and Luis García, former FC Barcelona player, who took the opportunity to welcome the fans and have their picture taken with them.
      The store is located right in the centre in the historic Palacio de Gavira, and has a total of 190 m2 divided into two floors, offering a space for 100% Barça experiences. It is an innovative point of sale in line with sister stores that observe the same design scheme, a highly characteristic concept that the club has been capturing in each of its latest openings.
      This is the first such store outside of Catalonia, and the tenth official store managed 100% by Barça, along with those at Spotify Camp Nou, Canaletes, Passeig de Gracia, Sagrada Família, Westfield La Maquinista, La Roca Village, the corner at El Cort Inglés and Barcelona airport terminals T1 and T2..</p>
    <p><img src="img/News1.jpg"  style="width:1500px;height:500px;"alt="n" class="f-left" />FC Barcelona stores all combine new technologies and characteristic elements related to the club's tradition, seeking to offer visitors a unique Barça experience. They are greeted with a mosaic created from typical Madrid tiles, and a picture that pays homage to the city of Barcelona and some of its most prominent landmarks, including La Pedrera and the Sagrada Família, works by Antoni Gaudí, along with other elements that form part of the city's iconic skyline, as well as some of the team's greatest players.
        The ground floor is dedicated mainly to men's and women's clothing. The different shop windows feature LED screens showing images of the Camp Nou and some of the main 100% Barça collections. Fans coming to the store will feel part of the atmosphere and excitement experienced in the stadium, thanks to the different audiovisual and dynamic devices. 
        The first floor contains the children's collection and the printing lab area, where fans can personalise their Barça shirts if they like. The whole establishment is inspired by Barça and Catalan images, which can be seen from the street through the large windows. Visitors will also find all the official kits for the 2022/23 season, training gear and also exclusive 100% Barça collections that only available at points of sale managed directly by the club.</p>

        <p>Madrid woke up to a surprise this Thursday. At Calle Atocha 75, a huge advertising hoarding appeared with the message 'Raúl es culer', supporting the opening of a brand new Barça Store in the heart of the Spanish capital, in C/Arenal 9, and which opened at noon today.</p>
        <p><img src="img/News2.jpg"  style="width:1500px;height:500px;"alt="n" class="f-left" />Who is Raúl?
          Raúl is a Barça supporter who lives in Madrid and who was the inspiration for this campaign that will be replicated in other streets of the city.
          
          It is a way to arouse interest in the new retail outlet in the city, whose opening was attended by director Xavier Barbany and former player Luis García. The latter played for Barça B in the nineties prior to making his first team debut in 2000.</p>

          Four reasons for optimismd</a></h2>
        <div class="article-info box">

        <p>Every time the blaugranes have reached 53 points or more after 20 games, they have gone on to win La Liga</p>
        <p><img src="img/_SG_1967(1).JPG"  style="width:1500px;height:500px;"alt="n" class="f-left" />Top of the table with an eight point advantage over their nearest rivals, Barça begin the second half of the league campaign perfectly placed. So far Xavi Hernández's team have recorded 17 wins, 2 draws and just one defeat in La Liga, picking up 53 points in 20 matches. 

          Nevertheless, it is not the first time that the blaugranes have been in this position, having 50 points or more after 20 games. On no less than four separate occasions the team have had similar figures and on each occasion they have gone on to claim the league championship. 
          Four precedents, four league titles 
          The first precedent comes in the 2008/09 season, the first under Pep Guardiola as coach. The blaugranes recorded 53 points in 20 matches, an identical record to Xavi's team although this season the team have conceded just seven goals where in 2008/09 at this point in the campaign they had let in 14. Guardiola's Barça side went to claim the league title that season with 87 points at the end of the season, winning 27 games, drawing six and losing just five. 
          
          Two seasons later Barça repeated that excellent start to the campaign. In 2010/11 Guardiola's team recorded 18 wins in 20 matches, claiming a total of 55 points. At the end of the season 96 points was enough to take the league title, four points ahead of their nearest rivals. In 2012/13 Barça again claimed 55 points in 20 matches and went to win La Liga once more with a total of 100 points. 
          
          The most recent precedent comes in the 2017/18 campaign when the team picked up 54 points in the first 20 games of the campaign with 17 wins and three draws. At the end of the season a total of 93 points from 28 wins, 9 draws and just one defeat was enough for another league championship. 
          
          So, in short, the omens are good as every time Barça have reached a total of 53 points in the first 20 matches of the league season they have ended the campaign as La Liga champions. </p>

              15 in a row unbeaten for FC Barcelona</a></h2>

            <p>The blaugranes' unbeaten run stretches back to October and if they avoid defeat in their next match it will be the best run under coach Xavi Hernández</p>
            <p><img src="img/Promo-comms-FUT.jpg"  style="width:1500px;height:500px;"alt="n" class="f-left" />After their last win against Sevilla at the weekend, Barça now are in the midst of a 15 game unbeaten run in all competitions. Xavi Hernández's were last beaten on 26 October when they went down to a 3-0 defeat against Bayern Munich in the Champions League at Spotify Camp Nou. On Sunday against Villarreal away from home in La Liga they will have the chance to make it 16 games without defeat for the first tim under coach Xavi Hernández.The previous best under Xavi more than a year ago 
              It is not the first time that Xavi Hernández has led the side to an run of 15 games without defeat. Last season under the former Barça player the team recorded 11 wins and four draws between January and April 2022 before the streak came to an end with a 3-2 defeat at home to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League. 
              
              The current run has seen Barça record 13 wins and just two draws (one against Espanyol and one against Betis in the Spanish Super Cup that ended with the blaugranes' victory on penalties). In the 15 game run Barça have, of course, claimed silverware with their win over Real Madrid in the final of the Spanish Super Cup. In 2023 the blaugranes have 10 wins in 10 matches in all competitions. 
              
              A similar run four years ago 
              To find a similar run under a previous coach we have to skip past Ronald Koeman and Quique Setién to a time when Ernesto Valverde was in charge. The current Athletic Club coach led the team to a 23 game unbeaten in 2019 comprising of 17 wins and six draw before a 2-0 win for Celta in Balaídos ended the blaugranes' streak. 
              
              The year before Valverde led the side to an 18 game unbeaten streak of 13 wins and five draws that was ended by defeat in the Champions League against AS Roma. 
              
              However, Xavi's side are still a long way off the longest run in the Club's history which was set with Luis Enrique as coach in the 2015/16 season. The blaugranes went 39 games without defeat with 32 wins and seven draws on that particular occasion. </p>
